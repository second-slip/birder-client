# BirderClient

Angular 14 client app for the Birder website. 


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Add environment.ts file to compile

The development environment configuration file (environment.ts) is untracked.  You need to add the environment.ts file to a cloned copy of the repsository. This should be added to the environments folder and it should follow the same structure as the environment.prod.ts file which _is_ tracked in this repository.

## Fake REST API for testing

[json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) files which can be used to fake the Birder REST API are available on request (they are not tracked in this repository).

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
